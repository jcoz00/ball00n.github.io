Finally after a long while of inactivity, I am officially back into developing. I am very excited to share my new projects upcoming for this year, so with out further to do...

My Cydia APT Repository is online. You can access it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/repo).

[Oblivion]({{ site.baseurl }}/repo/depictions/?p=com.jcoz00.oblivion) is a custom setup that can be installed through Cydia and applied with utility FlashBack.

I have released a slew of recommendation packages to install along with the new iOS 12 Jailbreak. They are all basically meta packages that can install CLI Tools, Tweaks and Utilities that I use daily. In addition, I have added many repository packages that directly install other Cydia Repositories that I use often.

Moving on from the subject of iOS, I am almost ready to release Minecraft Server Installer and Executor (MSIE) for macOS. This is a Bash script that can be executed and will automatically install and run a Spigot-Fork Minecraft server for you in minutes! No more hassle.

More projects to come in the future.
