James is an innovative thinker with an innate passion to help those in need. From an early age, James set his sights on medicine and strives to educate himself and deliver care wherever possible. In 2018, James began a position at a local Walgreens Pharmacy and has since fostered a knowledge of pharmaceuticals, doctor-patient interaction, insurances, and pharmaceutical distribution. Alongside this, he began an internship at Illinois Bone and Joint Institute to further expand his knowledge of medicine, its sub-specialties, and inspire him to pursue orthopedics. James is currently enrolled at Michigan State University where he is studying Human Biology and additionally minoring in Pharmacology and Toxicology. From there, James plans to apply to medical school and eventually offer his acquired knowledge to those in need.
